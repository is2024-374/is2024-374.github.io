### Title
- Training Universal Vocoders with Feature Smoothing-based Augmentation Methods for High-quality TTS Systems
### Abstract
- While universal vocoders have demonstrated proficient waveform generation across diverse voices, their integration into text-to-speech (TTS) tasks often results in degraded synthetic quality. To address this challenge, we present a novel augmentation technique for training universal vocoders. Our training scheme randomly applies linear smoothing filters to input acoustic features, facilitating vocoder generalization across a wide range of smoothings. It significantly mitigates the training-inference mismatch, enhancing the naturalness of synthetic output even when the TTS acoustic model produces overly smoothed acoustic features. Notably, our method is applicable to any neural vocoder without requiring architectural modifications or dependencies on specific acoustic models. Experimental results validate the superiority of our vocoder over conventional methods, achieving 11.99% and 12.05% improvements in mean opinion scores when integrated with Tacotron 2 and FastSpeech 2 TTS acoustic models, respectively.
